# Women's Refuge Site Shield

This small module is to help you add the [Women's Refuge Shielded Site button](https://shielded.co.nz/) to your SilverStripe website.

# Usage

This code will help you add the shield to your SilverStripe website.

Select the preferred size in your SiteConfig, and the `WomensRefugeShieldControllerExtension` will inject the necessary javascript and css in to your pages.

That's all there is to it.

# Installation

Include the pride code with `composer require andrewandante/womens-refuge-shield` and select your preferred size in the CMS under Settings.
